# PORTFOLIO

## About me
My name is Zuzanna Rzycka and I'm almost master of physiotherapy.For several months I have been gaining new skills in the field of manual testing. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. I am a person who likes to learn new things, the ability to think logically, plan and analyze are my main features. I am great at carrying out complex tasks and optimizing processes.  In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.

### My experience
I have been working as a medical registration manager in a physiotherapeutic office for almost 3 years, where I manage a team of registrars and therapists. I am responsible for patient service, event planning, schedule consistency, supplies, statistics, billing and I am responsible for the daily proper functioning of the office.
